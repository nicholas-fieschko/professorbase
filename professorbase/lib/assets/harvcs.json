{"website": "http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~valiant", "bio": "Computer science encompasses the study of both artificial as well as natural phenomena. The former concern artificially created devices such as computers. The latter relate to the many step-by-step, or computational, processes found in nature such as in the brain or in the course of biological evolution. In most areas, whether natural or artificial, the ultimate limitations of such processes are as yet not well understood. The potential of computing devices may be currently far from being fully realized, while fundamental quantitative questions in neuroscience and evolution remain unanswered. Professor Valiant's current research focuses on a number of such basic questions. The majority of computational problems, including those with explicit mathematical characterizations such as the NP-complete problems, fall within the category of those for which the question of how best to compute them is little understood. These core problems of complexity theory remain the most fundamental mathematical challenges of computer science. They are related to foundational questions in quantum physics, most notably through polynomial time versions of the Turing hypothesis. Professor Valiant has proposed algebraic formulations of these questions, and is currently pursuing the holographic approach. In computer systems major conceptual challenges remain in controlling, load-balancing and programming large parallel systems, whether they be multicore devices on a chip or highly distributed systems. Professor Valiant's most recent interest in this area concerns the problem of how to design algorithms for multi-core devices that are portable, and run efficiently on wide classes of architectural designs with widely varying performance characteristics. A fundamental question for artificial intelligence is to characterize the computational building blocks that are necessary for cognition. A specific challenge is to build on the success of machine learning so as to cover broader issues in intelligence. This requires, in particular a reconciliation between two contradictory characteristics--the apparent logical nature of reasoning and the statistical nature of learning. Professor Valiant has developed a formal system, called robust logics, that aims to achieve\u00a0 such a reconciliation. In neuroscience a widely open problem remains how the weak model of computation that cortex apparently offers can support cognitive computation at all. Professor Valiant has been working on showing how broad sets of primitive operations can be computed robustly and on a significant scale even on such a weak model. A challenge in a different direction is understanding how Darwinian evolution can evolve complex mechanisms in the numbers of generations and with population sizes that have apparently been available on earth. Darwin's notions of variation and selection are computational notions and offer a very direct challenge for quantitative analysis by the methods of computer science. What is sought is a quantitative understanding of the possibilities and limitations of the basic Darwinian process.\u00a0", "name": "Leslie Valiant", "title": "T.

Research in the field pursues both scientific and engineering goals, undergirded by foundational formal and mathematical tools. Professor Shieber works on all of these aspects of the field. How natural languages are structured to permit efficient communication is a difficult and multi-faceted question, involving issues in linguistics (the syntactic and semantic structure of natural languages), theoretical computer science (the inherent complexity of aspects of human language); computer systems (in connection with the design and deployment of algorithms for natural-language analysis and generation); psychology (human sentence processing and misprocessing); and artificial intelligence (the encoding of general knowledge and its application to the understanding of utterances).

{"website": "http://grosz.seas.harvard.edu", "bio": "One of the major challenges for computer science in the next decade is to create the scientific and technological base for easy-to-use, large-scale information systems. Better systems for human-computer communication are an essential part of this challenge, and. theories and models of collaboration are needed to provide foundations for constructing systems able to work with each other and with the people using them. Professor Grosz's research group addresses fundamental problems in modeling collaborative activity, developing systems (\"agents\") able to collaborate with each other and their users, and constructing collaborative, multi-modal systems for human-computer communication. Professor Grosz is also attempting to identify the basic structures and processes by which people use natural languages to communicate, focusing in particular on the mechanisms involved in dialogue and spontaneous speech. Professor Grosz's research group uses the SharedPlans model of collaboration in developing intelligent computer \"agents\"; that work together in teams. This model handles arbitrary numbers of agents and multiple levels of action decomposition, and it is comprehensive in its treatment of partiality of belief and intention. The research group is also addressing fundamental questions of coordination and group decision making in the context of group of activity. Professor Grosz has developed a theory of discourse structure that specifies how discourse interpretation depends on interactions among speaker intentions, attentional state, and linguistic form. She has been using the theory to study the use of intonation to convey information about discourse structure, for instance how tones demark, in spoken language, some of the structure that paragraphs and parentheses indicate in written language. This work is likely to lead to better computer speech-synthesis systems. These two strands of research are being combined in an effort (joint with Professor Stuart Shieber) that aims to provide the scientific and technological base for a new paradigm for human-computer interaction, one that would enable the principled design of multi-modal dialogue-supporting interfaces. This research is investigating ways in which a theoretical understanding of collaborative activity can inform in a principled manner the design of concrete software interfaces. Grosz was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2008, the American Philosophical Society in 2003, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2004. She is a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. For her groundbreaking research that crosses disciplines, she is also the recipient of the ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award. In 1993, she became the first woman president of the AAAI.

A major focus of his research has been to explore how lower-level design issues such as power dissipation and chip cooling can be modeled and addressed when making early-stage architectural decisions in computer systems. Exploring new architectures and software techniques that are aware of energy, temperature, and other lower-level design metrics is extremely important when designing modern computer systems. New emphasis on computer systems that optimize design metrics besides raw performance, such as battery life, form-factor, and cost-efficiency provide many new challenges for system designers. As the underlying technology continues to evolve, new design issues arise and existing challenges become more difficult. In many cases, architectures that are aware of these issues provide superior overall solutions. Professor Brooks' recent work has focused on linking architectural performance simulators with early stage power and temperature models.
