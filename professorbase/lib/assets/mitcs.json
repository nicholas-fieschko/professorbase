He received the S.B. and the Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1968 and 1973, respectively. He has been involved in artificial intelligence research at M.I.T. since 1964. His research has centered on understanding the problem-solving strategies used by scientists and engineers, with the goals of automating parts of the process and formalizing it to provide more effective methods of science and engineering education. Sussman has also worked in computer languages, in computer architecture and in VLSI design.</p> \r\n\r\n <p>Sussman is a coauthor (with Hal Abelson and Julie Sussman) of the introductory computer science textbook used at M.I.T. The textbook, \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,\" has been translated into French, German, Chinese, Polish, and Japanese. As a result of this and other contributions to computer-science education, Sussman received the ACM's Karl Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award in 1990, and the Amar G. Bose award for teaching in 1991.</p> \r\n\r\n <p>Sussman's contributions to Artificial Intelligence include problem solving by debugging almost-right plans, propagation of constraints applied to electrical circuit analysis and synthesis, dependency-based explanation and dependency-based backtracking, and various language structures for expressing problem-solving strategies. Sussman and his former student, Guy L. Steele Jr., invented the Scheme programming language in 1975.</p> \r\n\r\n <p>Sussman saw that Artificial Intelligence ideas can be applied to computer-aided design. Sussman developed, with his graduate students, sophisticated computer-aided design tools for VLSI. Steele made the first Scheme chips in 1978. These ideas and the AI-based CAD technology to support them were further developed in the Scheme chips of 1979 and 1981. The technique and experience developed was then used to design other special-purpose computers. Sussman was the principal designer of the Digital Orrery, a machine designed to do high-precision integrations for orbital-mechanics experiments. The Orrery was designed and built by a few people in a few months, using AI-based simulation and compilation tools.</p> \r\n\r\n <p>Using the Digital Orrery, Sussman has worked with Jack Wisdom to discover numerical evidence for chaotic motions in the outer planets. The Digital Orrery is now retired at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. Sussman was also the lead designer of the Supercomputer Toolkit, another multiprocessor computer optimized for evolving systems of ordinary differential equations. The Supercomputer Toolkit was used by Sussman and Wisdom to confirm and extend the discoveries made with the Digital Orrery to include the entire planetary system.</p> \r\n\r\n <p>Sussman has pioneered the use of computational descriptions to communicate methodological ideas in teaching subjects in Electrical Circuits and in Signals and Systems. Over the past decade Sussman and Wisdom have developed a subject that uses computational techniques to communicate a deeper understanding of advanced Classical Mechanics. Computational algorithms are used to express the methods used in the analysis of dynamical phenomena. Expressing the methods in a computer language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally effective. Students are expected to read our programs and to extend them and to write new ones. The task of formulating a method as a computer-executable program and debugging that program is a powerful exercise in the learning process. Also, once formalized procedurally, a mathematical idea becomes a tool that can be used directly to compute results. Sussman and Wisdom, with Meinhard Mayer, have produced a new textbook, \"Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics,\" to capture these new ideas.</p> \r\n\r\n <p>Sussman is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), a fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is also a bonded locksmith, a life member of the American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute (AWI), a member of the Massachusetts Watchmakers-Clockmakers Association, a member of the Amateur Telescope Makers of Boston (ATMOB), and a member of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL). </p> \n        ", "name": "Gerald Sussman", "title": "Professor", "phone": "+1 (617) 253-5874", "publications": ["Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics, Gerald Jay Sussman and Jack Wisdom with Meinhard E.

Our group has a very productive interdisciplinary collaboration with leading biologists that has allowed us to tackle extraordinarily difficult and interesting problems that underlie cellular function and development. Current work in our laboratory is examining how we can computationally model chromatin modifying complexes that are associated with the genome of living yeast cells. New kinds of mechanistic computational models are necessary to capture how chromatin structure encodes cellular memory, and how the state of this memory is used to control gene expression. In particular, we are investigating new modular graphical models that use mechanistic constraints to describe biological mechanism. A new focus is an interdisciplinary project that seeks to build computational models of the transcriptional regulatory networks that control the differentiation of specific cell types. Elucidating these regulatory networks will enable us to define the regulatory processes that determine a cell's progress to its terminally differentiated state, and position us to differentiate embryonic stem (ES) cells for the treatment of debilitating human diseases. New computational techniques for elucidating transcriptional regulatory networks based on the integration of diverse high-throughput experimental data (genome sequence, chromatin structure, transcription factor-DNA binding, gene expression) provide a powerful foundation for discovering the detailed mechanisms of regulatory network control of cell differentiation during development.\n        ", "name": "Dave Gifford", "title": "Professor", "phone": "+1 (617) 253-6039", "publications": ["Bar-Joseph, Z., Gerber, G.

He wrote the first paper on systolic architectures with H.T. Kung and invented the retiming method of digital circuit optimization. He designed and led the implementation of the network architecture for the Connection Machine Model CM-5 Supercomputer produced by Thinking Machines Corporation, which incorporated the fat-tree interconnection network he developed at MIT. Fat-trees are now the preferred interconnect strategy for Infiniband technology. His textbook, <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em>, coauthored with Ronald L. Rivest and Thomas H. Cormen was named \"Best 1990 Professional and Scholarly Book in Computer Science and Data Processing\" by the Association of American Publishers. Currently in its third edition with an additional coauthor Clifford Stein, it is the leading textbook on computer algorithms and, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/\">Citeseerx</a> , the most cited reference in computer science. As Director of System Architecture at Akamai Technologies, he led the engineering team that developed a world-wide content-distribution network numbering over 20,000 servers. He introduced the notion of cache-oblivious algorithms, which exploit the memory hierarchy near optimally while containing no tuning parameters for cache size or cache-line length. He developed the Cilk multithreaded programming technology, which featured the first provably efficient work-stealing scheduler. He led the development of several Cilk-based parallel chess-playing programs which have won numerous prizes in international competition. With Matteo Frigo, he founded Cilk Arts, Inc., which developed the Cilk++ multicore concurrency platform and was acquired by Intel Corporation in 2009. He was for many years the head of the computer-science program for the Singapore-MIT Alliance distance-education collaboration. His annual workshop on <em>Leadership Skills for Engineering and Science Faculty</em>, cotaught with Chuck McVinney, has educated hundreds of faculty at MIT and around the world in the nontechnical issues involved in leading technical teams in academia.
