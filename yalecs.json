Many scientists have used computer simulations to model complex interactions of neural function, sensory processing, and motor control. Scassellati believes that robotics offers a new kind of tool in investigating human behavior. By building robotic systems based on models of human intelligence, the full complexity of real world environments can be used in evaluating these models. This research integrates work from artificial intelligence, machine vision, classical robotics, psychology, cognitive science, and human-machine interfaces.</p> <p>One of the major focuses of Scassellati\u2019s work has been on how children develop social skills and an understanding of other people. Children gradually acquire many skills that allow them to learn from their interactions with adults, such as responding to pointing gestures, recognizing what someone else is looking at, and representing that other people have beliefs, goals, and desires that differ from those of the child. These abilities have often been called a \u201ctheory of mind\u201d and are believed to be critical for language acquisition, for self-recognition, and in the development of imaginative play. Computational models of these skills are being developed, implemented, and tested on robotic platforms currently under construction. His previous robots have performed tasks such as imitating human arm gestures, distinguishing animate from inanimate stimuli based on self-propelled motion criteria, and learning to reach for visual targets.</p> <p>By building machines with social skills, we can not only begin to model human development but also construct machines with more natural interfaces. Machines that can engage in the same social dynamics that people use with each other will be easier to use, will be usable in a wider range of situations, and will not require the user to learn arbitrary commands.</p> <p>One of Scassellati\u2019s current projects is to develop robotic systems that aid in the diagnosis of autism by autonomously classifying social interactions.

The goal of a code obfuscation\u00a0is to hide secrets in software by \u201cobfuscating\u201d the internal mechanisms of a program while preserving access\u00a0to its functionality which enables the evaluation of the program on any input. Such capabilities would allow to\u00a0implement proprietary algorithms, e.g., DNA analysis algorithms, in software that enables the use of the algorithm\u00a0while protecting its inner workings. Hiding secrets into software may also be crucial for the effectiveness of some\u00a0particular applications such as malware analysis tools that may need to include malware signatures.

Obfuscation\u00a0is also used for the construction of many new and very useful cryptographic functionalities such as a functional\u00a0encryption, which is a special type of encryption that reveals only partial information about the encrypted messages,\u00a0and protocols for efficient computation outsourcing, which allows a computationally powerful party such as the\u00a0cloud to do work on behalf of a weak client without learning its private inputs.

One of his perennial interests is in planning algorithms, which calculate structures of actions for autonomous agents of various sorts. He did seminal work in the area of \u201chierarchical planning\u201d in the 1970s. In the last decade, his focus has switched to regression-based techniques for classical planning, especially methods that heuristically search through situation space. He was instrumental in starting the biannual series of AI Planning Systems (AIPS) conferences. In 1998, he ran the first ever Planning Competition in conjunction with AIPS; it has now become a standard part of the ICAPS conference, the merger of AIPS and the European Conference on Planning (ECP).</p> <p>Another enduring interest of Prof. McDermott\u2019s is in the area of knowledge representation (KR), which is the attempt to formalize what people know in a form usable by a computer. He wrote some influential papers on nonmonotonic logic and representation of temporal knowledge. However, in the mid-1980s he became convinced that the KR project, in its more ambitious formulations, was ill-defined. He published a paper titled \u201cA Critique of Pure Reason\u201d making this case. However, Prof. McDermott is now thinking about KR issues again, this time in conjunction with the problem of \u201cmetadata\u201d on the world-wide web, which will tell automated agents what the content and capability of a web resource is. Hopefully solving this problem will not require tackling the original KR problem, which he still believes to be hopeless.</p> <p>Prof. McDermott is a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence.</p>", "name": "Drew Mcdermott", "title": "Professor of Computer Science ", "phone": "203-432-1284", "publications": [], "address": "AKW 508, 51 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511-8937", "email": "drew.mcdermott@yale.edu", "profile_link": "http://cpsc.yale.edu/people/drew-mcdermott"},

She received a B.A. in Mathematics from Harvard and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford. Between finishing her Ph.D. in 1986 and starting at Yale in 2000, she was with AT&amp;T, most recently in the Information Sciences Research Center of the AT&amp;T Shannon Laboratory in Florham Park, NJ. There she established a research group in the emerging area of algorithmics for massive data sets and served as manager of the group for two years.</p> <p>Professor Feigenbaum\u2019s research interests include Internet algorithms, computational complexity, security and privacy, and digital copyright. She has a long-standing interest in fundamental problems in complexity theory that are motivated by cryptology and is co-inventor (with former colleagues Matt Blaze and Jack Lacy) of the security-research area of \u201ctrust management.\u201d More recently, she has worked on basic algorithms for massive data sets, particularly those generated in network operations and business-to-consumer e-commerce. With collaborators Sampath Kannan, Martin Strauss, and Mahesh Viswanathan, Professor Feigenbaum has devised several highly influential algorithms for network-generated massive data, including a randomized algorithm for deciding whether two streams of router measurements are approximately equivalent and another for deciding whether a stream is close to having the \u201cgroupedness\u201d property (a natural relaxation of the sortedness property). Within the area of e-commerce foundations, she has also worked on the interplay of incentives and computation. Using tools from microeconomics and game theory, computer scientists are now developing a theory of \u201cincentive-compatible\u201d distributed computation. In joint work with Arvind Krishnamurthy, Christos Papadimitriou, Rahul Sami, and Scott Shenker, Professor Feigenbaum has studied incentive-compatible protocols for multicast cost/sharing and interdomain routing.</p> <p>Professor Feigenbaum has an extensive record of distinguished service to the Computer Science community.
